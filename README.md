Adds black windows to the SOCK (Shuttle Orbiter Construction Kit) shuttle, and the Buran shuttle. Which you can find it by going to SOCK's Github and clicking the button that says "Code" then clicking zip, then it should be in the Extras folder. The Buran doesnt have black windows for the hatch yet but will in the future. The SOCK shuttle has all black windows, and in the future I hope to get the MK-3 windows black.

To use simply merge the GameData folders and you're good to go!

!!If there are any bugs report them here at the GitHub!!

!!THE FILE IN THE MOD IS APPLIED TO BOTH BURAN AND THE SPACE SHUTTLE THERE IS NO WAY TO CHANGE THIS!! -> May be incorrect now.
